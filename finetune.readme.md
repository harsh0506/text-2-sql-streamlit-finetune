# README for Fine-Tuning GEMMA-2B for SQL Generation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the GEMMA-2B model from Google for generating SQL queries based on natural language questions. The GEMMA-2B model is a transformer-based language model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text. By fine-tuning this model on a specific dataset, we can adapt it to generate SQL queries from natural language inputs.

## The purpose of fine-tuning a transformer model like GEMMA-2B?
The fine-tuning process leverages the pre-trained model's knowledge of language structure and semantics, combined with the task-specific data to fine-tune the model's parameters. This results in a model that is both powerful and specialized, capable of performing the task with high accuracy and efficiency.

In the context of GEMMA-2B, fine-tuning can be particularly beneficial for prototyping and experimentation, as it allows for rapid iteration and testing of new ideas. The model's flexibility and the ease of fine-tuning make it an attractive option for developers and researchers working on NLP projects, enabling them to quickly adapt the model to their specific needs and objectives

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library for Python, used for model training and inference.
- **Transformers**: A state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for Python, developed by Hugging Face. It provides thousands of pre-trained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, and generation.
- **BitsAndBytes**: A library for efficient model quantization and compression, used to reduce the model size and improve inference speed.
- **Peft**: A library for efficient model training and inference, used to optimize the training process.
- **TRL**: A library for reinforcement learning, used to fine-tune the model.
- **Accelerate**: A library for easy distributed training, used to scale the training process across multiple GPUs.
- **Datasets**: A library for loading and preprocessing datasets, used to prepare the training data.
- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that provides free access to computing resources.

## Role of BitsAndBytes in the fine-tuning process?

BitsAndBytes plays a crucial role in the fine-tuning process of transformer models like GEMMA-2B by facilitating model quantization. Model quantization is a technique that reduces the memory and computational costs of machine learning models by representing weights and activations with lower-precision data types, such as 8-bit integers (int8) or even 4-bit integers.

In the context of fine-tuning GEMMA-2B, BitsAndBytes is integrated with the Hugging Face Transformers library to simplify the quantization process. This integration allows for the fine-tuning of models loaded in 8-bit or 4-bit quantization, making it easier to work with large models. The BitsAndBytesConfig class in the Transformers library provides options to enable 8-bit or 4-bit quantization, adjusting the precision of the model's parameters to optimize performance and resource usage.

## How does the Peft library optimize the training process?

the PEFT library optimizes the fine-tuning process for Gemma models by employing low-rank adaptation techniques, reducing memory and compute requirements, preserving original model weights, and enabling portability and storage efficiency. These strategies make PEFT a powerful tool for fine-tuning large language models on limited resources while maintaining high performance levels.

## What is the significance of using TRL for fine-tuning the model?

The significance of using TRL for fine-tuning models lies in its ease of use, integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem, support for PEFT methods, flexibility and customization options, and efficiency in handling large-scale model adaptation. These features make TRL a valuable tool for fine-tuning models like gemma-2b for various applications and tasks.

## Process

### 1. Environment Setup

The script begins by installing necessary Python packages using pip. These packages include the Transformers library, BitsAndBytes for model quantization, and other dependencies required for the project.

### 2. Model and Tokenizer Initialization

The script initializes the GEMMA-2B model and its tokenizer using the Transformers library. The model is configured with BitsAndBytes for efficient quantization, and the tokenizer is used to preprocess the input text.

### 3. Fine-Tuning Configuration

A configuration for fine-tuning is set up, including the model architecture, training parameters, and the dataset to be used for fine-tuning. The configuration specifies the target modules for quantization, the type of task (Causal Language Modeling), and other training parameters.

### 4. Dataset Preparation

The script loads a dataset of SQL queries and their corresponding natural language questions. The dataset is preprocessed and tokenized using the GEMMA-2B tokenizer.

### 5. Training

The model is fine-tuned on the prepared dataset using the specified configuration. The training process involves generating SQL queries from natural language inputs and comparing them to the ground truth SQL queries to update the model's parameters.

### 6. Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its performance in generating SQL queries from natural language inputs.

### 7. Saving and Sharing

The fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved locally. Additionally, they are pushed to the Hugging Face Model Hub, making them publicly available for others to use.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of transformer models like GEMMA-2B in adapting to specific tasks through fine-tuning. By fine-tuning GEMMA-2B on a dataset of SQL queries and natural language questions, we can create a model capable of generating SQL queries from natural language inputs, opening up new possibilities for automating data analysis and query generation.
